This generate_sample.sh tool is used to generate sample config files
from OpenStack project source trees.

Run it by passing the base directory and package name i.e.

  $> generate_sample.sh --base-dir /opt/stack/nova --package-name nova \
                        --output-dir /opt/stack/nova/etc
  $> generate_sample.sh -b /opt/stack/quantum -p nova -o /opt/stack/quantum/etc

Watch out for warnings about modules like libvirt, qpid and zmq not
being found - these warnings are significant because they result
in options not appearing in the generated config file.
